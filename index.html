                    <p>Over years, TCP becomes notorious for degraded data delivery performance, which a vast majority of Internet applications suffer from. Great efforts has been poured to proposing TCP modifications, which essentially ``patch'' for performance problems in specific network conditions such as high bandwidth long delay links, satellite links, data center, wireless and lossy links, and etc. Unfortunately, we are losing the battle against production network’s rapid evolution towards unprecedented complexity: The very fact that there are so many TCP variants suggests that each is only a point solution: they yield better performance under specific network conditions, but break in others. Worse, we found through real-world experiments that in many cases the performance of these special TCP variants is still quite far from optimal even in the network conditions towards which they are specially engineered.  We believe the TCP family has little hope to achieve consistent high performance due to a fundamental architectural deficiency: hard-wiring packet-level events to control responses without understanding the real performance result of its actions.</p>

<p>We propose Performance-oriented Congestion Control (PCC), a new congestion control architecture in which each sender continuously observes what is the real meaningful resulting performance (utility) for its sending at certain rate. PCC then directly observes and compares different sending rates’ resulting utility and learns how to adjust its rate to improve empirical utility through a learning control algorithm. By avoiding any assumptions about the underlying potentially-complex network, PCC tracks the empirically optimal sending rate and thus achieves consistent high performance. PCC’s learning control is selfish in nature, but surprisingly, using a widely applicable utility function, competing PCC senders provably converge to a fair equilibrium. Across many real-world and challenging environments, PCC shows consistent and often 10× performance improvement, with better fairness and stability than TCP. Moreover, PCC provides a flexibility beyond TCP’s architecture: expressing different objectives of data transfer, e.g. throughput/latency, with different utility functions. Though being a significant shift in architecture PCC requires no router hardware support or new packet format to deploy.

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
